    <p>I am seemingly boring at first but once you get to know me <br>and we spend a bit of time together I feel like we would get along. I don't like to talk to many new people that often mainly because I like doing my own things a lot.</p>

    <p>If you couldn't already tell from the picture above I love to use Python as one of the main programming language that I use. From the image above it is a small portion of a fully functional contact book I was making as a finals for one of my years in high school more about projects I have done and  that I plan to do will be on the "Projects" page</p></div>
