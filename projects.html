        <p>Many of my projects were made in Python because it is what I was accustomed to for the longest before I got introduced to C# and HTML learning these different languages gave me a big understanding of the way websites and onjects worked in many different aspects. I am very thankful for being able to have this opportunity to doing what I love and continue learning to start a career out of it.</p>
        <p>For many of my Python project I use an IDE called <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/">PyCharm</a> it is a very helpful tool where there are many aspects that make it seem so much more superior than others. I love to use this as my main IDE and would recommend others to use it as well. </p>

        <p style="text-align:left">Here to the left is a picture of one of my projects that I was making in my 10th grade year. This was a very special type of project because it was a submission for one of my AP classes so I wanted to make it as best I could. I chose to make a contact book because people use it all the time sometimes without even realizing it. The contact book stores information of people you have made note of to keep track of things like their number, name, address, etc.</p>
        <img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52035774907_2da44162a0_b.jpg" alt="Code that shows how the information was stored." style="float:right" width="200" height="150">
        <p style="text-align:right">Of course there wouldn't be much point of this project if you couldn't actually store any of the information anywhere so I created a file that I would append all the information into. Doing so made it way more realistic when creating a contact using this program. Of course I would still like to add tons more work into this project because I wasn't satisfied with the way it was working at the time so I added another part to see if the user would like to view any information and for which person.</p>
        <p>This became one of the projects that took super long to do but was very enjoyable along the way, I learned many things about Python and tricks that I didn't imagine would even be legal in Python. The outcome of this project was a very great learning experience showing me how big projects can be, even though I feel like the project is still a work in progress I'm satisfied with how it is for now, and I imagine there are more projects far bigger than this one.</p>

        <h2 style="text-align:center">Basic Calculator (Python)</h2>
        <p>This is one of the more simpler projects but still a very important project to me because this is when I was just getting into the coding experience. Building something this simple was a struggle for me because I had little understanding to the syntax in Python and the many errors that I received. From here I learned that it was still very enjoyable to myself and realized this is the career path I wanted to follow because of the satisfaction you feel once completing a task very difficult to do.</p>

        <p style="text-align:left"><br><br><br>Here is the picture that shows the code, it is very simple like I mentioned but I still remember this and the way I struggled being able to do something so simple when all I was doing was repeating a code 2 times then printing back out to user.</p>

        <h2>Company/Service Project (C#)</h2>
        <p>This project was a rollercoaster since I wanted to make it similar to the Contact Book project. It felt so new not having to indent anything but remembering to put ; at the end of each line and being able to add more code on the same line, it was sort of overwhelming but very interesting to me.<br>The Company/Service Project is a project in which I wanted to have the user be presented a menu and let them have the freedom of being able to choose something from the menu. After being able to choose what they wanted I then would ask them of any changes were needed to be made in their order, after that I would make a new file and have everything they ordered added on there. This would then leave a thank you note at the end. </p>

        <p style="text-align:left"><br>This screenshot to the left shows the variables made and the way I introduced the user to the program. I wanted to try my best to keep it nice and simple so the user could get through it without it being too much of a hassle.</p>

        <p style="text-align:right">This image to the right shows how I ended the program and the way I was able to append the text into the text file. This gives the user their own copy of the receipt without it having to go away with the program finishing.</p>
